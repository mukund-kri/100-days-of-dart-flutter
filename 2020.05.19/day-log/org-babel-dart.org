* Setup dart with org-babel

** setup ob-dart
   
   The ~ob-dart~ package provides dart language support to
   org-babel. All I did was add the following to my init.el

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (use-package ob-dart)
   (add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages  '(dart . t))
   #+END_SRC

   The first line installs ~ob-dart~ from MELPA and the second
   registers dart mode with org-babel.


** TODOs

*** TODO use the ~:config~ of use-package to load the language support to org-babel
