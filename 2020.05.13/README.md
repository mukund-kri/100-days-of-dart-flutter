# Day 9 of 100

## dart libs

Today I did a deep dive into a couple of lib on pub.dev.

1. The `args` package. A package to create command line interfaces.
2. The `path` package. Utility function to manipulate paths.

## scripts

Going with the philosophy of 'Automate the Boring stuff' I created a
script that will generate an empty folder structure for each day of
this challenge.
