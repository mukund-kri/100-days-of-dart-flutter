# intl :: library for internationalization and localization

## DateFormat

Though the package provides classes ...
1. Intl				:: for internationalization,
2. NumberFormat		:: for formatting number in a locale specific way
3. DateFormat		:: data and time formatting
4. BidiForamtter	:: bi-directional text formatting

I'v used only the DateFormat class until now. I use the DateFormat in
my scripts to generate boilerplate for each day's code in my coding
challenges.

The `main.dart` file contains a few samples of formatting dates from
the docs and my usage.
