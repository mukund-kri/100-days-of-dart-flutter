* Day 14 / 100

** Libs exploration
   I spent a lot of time trying to get moor/moor-ffi to work on the
   dart vm only (non flutter). It seems moor is tied to flutter and
   running moor without flutter is beyond me. So I'm switching gears
   and starting working with flutter

** Flutter
   Created a simple flutter project with a stateful widget that
   increments a counter on tap gesture.
