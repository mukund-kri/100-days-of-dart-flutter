* Switching from markdown to org-mode

  I'm switching all newer documentation in the "100 days of Dart"
  challenge from markdown to org-mode.

** Why org-mode?
   
   1. I am more comfortable in org-mode than in markdown. Just because
      I'v been using emacs for a long time now. And most of my
      documentation is in org files.
   2. github has full support for org-mode, just a much as markdown.
   3. org-mode has much better support for list of lists
   4. org-babel lets me execute code snippets inside of org document
      to check the syntax.
   5. Integrates with my TODO system which is org-agenda

      and much more.

** TODOs

*** DONE convert all README.md in my templates to README.org
*** DONE update my ~challenges~ utility
