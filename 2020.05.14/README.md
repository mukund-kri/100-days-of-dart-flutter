## Made the script executable

In pubspec.yaml there is an executables section. In which you can specify 
a dart script and pub will wrap it in shell script and put it in a bin 
folder. Amazing. I really like this feature. 

The script folder contains my script that can be installed with 
`pub global activate ...`.

## Libs

Explored the `shell` package.
