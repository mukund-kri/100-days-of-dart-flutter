* dart:core uri class

** Why?
   I am currently writing a library to interact with Solr. The interaction
   mainly occurs via the http JSON API. I was constructing the URI with string
   concatination, but the URI class looks to be a safer/easier way to construct
   uri's.

** Basics
   Construct a few basic urls. And get a feel for the API.

** Query Parameters
   Use the uses case of Solr to explore query and query parameters.

** TODO TODOs
