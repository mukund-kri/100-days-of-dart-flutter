* Fullstack Heroes app

  A toy fullstack app with 3 parts

  1. Browser app with Angular Dart
  2. Server side with aqueduct + postgresql
  3. Flutter app for mobile

** Not there
   This is the *VERY BASIC* version. Rather than listing what's there, here's a
   list of what's not there. Implicitly this is also a TODO list.

   1. Any kind of tests
   2. Auth
   2. Proper error handling.
   3. Dockerization (Maybe)
   

** Angular Dart [Done]

** Server Side [Done]

** Flutter [Not Started]
