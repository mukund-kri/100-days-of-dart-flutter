# Day 11 / 100

## Library exploration 

### intl
Today I went a library called 'intl' that deals with
internationalization and localization. Specifically date formats. 

## Scripts
I improved my challenge code generator utility by creating a new
command which wraps around cookiecutter (a popular python tool kit) to
generate starter code for simple command line dart projects.

## Testing
I also learnt the basics of dart testing.

## Data Types

### Stacks
