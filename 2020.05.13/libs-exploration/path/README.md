# The path lib

This is a small library used for processing dir/file paths on
OS/Browser. It's roughly equivalent to python's os.path albeit quite a
bit smaller.

At the moment I'm fine with this lib and am using it extensively in my
'automate the boring stuff' scripts.

## This project

In the `bin/main.dart` file I explore a few function that I'm sure I
use a lot.

## references
